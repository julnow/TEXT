       "\t<tr><td>     I don't think a sustained hostility towards Jews by Arabs predates the arrival of Zionists in Palestine, Grant.  I mean Zionists and not Jews.  I mean people who arrived there with the express intention of creating a new nation.    Undoubtedly, Jews did not enjoy equality of status with Muslims in Muslim lands over the centuries, but then nor did people of any other faith.  They were certainly not of the lowest status.  Nor were they subject to the periodic pogroms in Arab lands that they endured in Europe.  On the whole, they were not badly treated in the context of the times.  Most histories that I have read of the region, predominently written by Jewish authors as it happens, are agreed on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>1</td><td> 7</td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Mistress,  Yes AQ types make up their own lines, but is it really such a good idea to confirm what they are saying?   Today's paper reports that the US and Israel planned the attack on Lebanon months ago. What is the justification for that? And doesn't it play straight into the hands of those who say the US is out to destroy Islam?  AQ is a small group, no more than a few thousand active members. From the press here it is reported that last weeks plot was foiled through a tip-off from a British Muslim and a few arrests in Pakistan. My take is we would be far more effective in dealing with that threat if we saw it as a police and security issue and not a \"war on terror\". Recent events would appear to bear that out. Seeing enemies rather than criminals legitimises those you are up against and therefore weakens the cooperation you are likely to get from  those who do not believe in your self-righteousness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>0</td><td> 9</td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>     The fact that you're missing here is what economists call PPP:  Purchasing Power Parity.  Goods are much cheaper in the US.  Even in the poorest parts of America, or at least the poorest parts that I've ever been to, people are very fat and have big cars.  They don't appear to be starving to me.  I'm sure you're right that the perpetrators of the Paris Carbecues are given more of ordinary taxpayers' money than they would be in the US.  How this benefits either them or France, however, is not clear from your explanation.  Incidentally, with respect to the redundant Guardian statistics on child poverty, the measure of child poverty that they're using is relative.  Since none of the people discussing these figures appear to understand even the most rudimentary statistics (normal distributions and standard deviations) because they're all sociology students, here's a quick summary:  The percentage figures that you call \"child poverty\" are actually a measure of the inequality of income distribution.  America appears to have a higher child poverty rate because it has a more unequal distribution.  And before you come back with 'Aha!', let me say I'm not against income inequality in the slightest.  Countries that do not have income inequality are either, as Gavin alluded, totalitarian dictatorships with a life expectancy of 40 or doomed social experiments like France.     Peace, wages and low taxes.  An illegal immigrant from Central America finding himself in New York will find a job, pay low taxes and experience less crime than an Algerian immigrant in the centre of Paris.  Don't forget all those middle class students are on the streets of Paris right now, campaigning against jobs.  So if you're an Algerian going to France, you're doing so because you expect a life of handouts.  But an immigrant to America is expecting a life of wages that will lead them into the middle class.</td><td>0</td><td>17</td></tr>\n",

I'm often confused about statements posted on this messageboard pretending like they're saying something concrete and therefore arguable, maybe I am just missing something, as in this case:  Please give examples of some of these \"anti semitist\" statements that you don't understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>0</td><td>1371</td></tr>\n",

       "\t<tr><td>Stuart,  I think you know quite a bit about being shallow as you demonstrate that through your failure to recognize the link between your narrow mined hero Karl Marx and Communist atrocities.  In your convoluted logic you seek to make inane claims while ignoring dates and facts. I can't help you if you are unable to comprehend simple dates. The US did not fund or approve of the Khmer Rouge even your link says that the humanitarian funds from the west came AFTER the Khrmer Rouge were driven into a corner by the other Communists , N. Vietnam. The Killing fields were just coming to the worlds attention as Cambodia was sealed off and all foriegners were exterminated.   I can't help it if in your zeal to demonize the US you become deluded.  Your Marxist / Communist propoganda politics are are surely part of your deliberate untruthful agenda.  You're a sad Communist relic that 'spins' the worlds events to serve your Communist agenda.

Tell me, what would you call the Vietnamese fighters who fought the US?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>1</td><td>1375</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><td>     'I won't dispute that, but that doesn't mean that Jews have a better claim.'  I never said they had a better claim but neither do the arabs. Why do you claim they do? Israel took the territory in a war of self defence. They are entitled to keep it until a peace deal is reached and by the looks of palestinian behaviour that won't be anytime soon. Since Israel withdrew from Gaza, 150 odd missiles have been fired from the territory.

       "\t<tr><td>     Nice try, but you can't wiggle out of things that way.  Let's summarise the position:  1.  You said you are a Nazi and an anti-semite and are rather proud of it.  2.  You said that the Koran is a fairy story, so the bit that says that believers have to kill Christians and Jews doesn't matter.  3. You said that the Talmud (which is not a holy scripture like the koran, but an iron age commentary on the bronze age Torah), while still being a fairy story, should be taken seriously.  4. The worst calumny you could find to lay against the Jews is that they require non-Jewish girls to undergo a ritual bath when they convert.  I think you're going down a dead end with this one, because each round of posting makes you appear more bigoted but less connected with the real world.  I think you would better off saying \"Look, I hate Jews but I don't really know why (it may be something to do with Jesus), therefore I will grasp at any straw.\"  This would be more in line with standard BBC policy.

       "\t<tr><td>     You do not seem to understand how the West has operatred in oil rich Middle Eastern countries. The USA made a deal in 1945 to protect the Saudi royal family in return for oil wealth. The Saudi population have not gained the benfits of the wealth.   When the British backed Iraqi monarch was overthrown in 1958, the West supported the right wing Baa'thists against the radical nationalists. Again, the ordinary Iraqis missed out.  The West sponsored a coup to overthrow the nationalist in Iran in 1953, placing its puppet monarch on the thrown. When the monarch was overthrown in 1979 the West gave encouragement to Iraq to wage an eight year war against Iran. The war was financed by the Arab sheikdoms that were friendly to the West.

       "\t<tr><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>anyhow, the greenhouses were bought for about &lt;a3&gt;7.2 for a population currently about 1.7 million ?  they were bought by former world bank head MrWolfen... and Yossi Beillein with their Economic co-operation foundation thingy about 2 weeks before the pull-out. Settlers had already (?) started destroying or dismantling their greenhouses, probably out of malice   and from what I can make out, the plot is ....  we (the charity) will buy the greenhouses off you settlers for the palestinians as long as you dont smash them up. since we dont trust you and are concerned you might not be tempted enough, we will give you half the money up front and half after you have been removed.   as far as I can make out, some were unuasable or whatever. they also need a market that will buy their goods.  from what i saw, the palestininas were looting in quite an orderly fashion. it wasnt just for the sake of destroying them.

       "\t<tr><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Hi stuart davison,  Stuart Davison quote: &lt;93&gt;I've not lied at all. Nice to see you admit that US funded Pol Pot.&lt;94&gt;   I was waiting for you to finally cave in to the bashing you are taking and try to play &lt;93&gt;smoke and mirrors&lt;94&gt; with the dates. I am just sorry you tried this defection to late on Friday for me to get the first punch in. Instead JJ fleming got that honor.  In 1980 the North Vietnamese in a &lt;93&gt;commie on Commie&lt;94&gt; blood bath had pushed the Khmer Rouge to the Thai border on the west side of Cambodia. There was a huge refugee issue with potentially thousands and thousands of Cambodians being pushed or fleeing to Thailand to escape the North Vietnamese troops or simply starvation.  Before under the Khmer Rouge the Cambodians just starved to death but now with a Khmer Rouge/North Vietnamese war going on they had the chance to jump the border and swamp Thailand (a US cold war ally).  The US along with NGOs supplied the Cambodian refugee camps AND KHMER ROUGE with food as a counter weight to the North Vietnamese take over of Cambodia. At the height of the cold war the US was scared of the domino effect on Thailand with thousands and thousands of Cambodian refugees fleeing and being pushed across the border.  It was at this time (post April 17th 1979) with the Vietnamese toppling of the Khmer Rouge that the killing fields, collective farming Gulags and all the death came to the attention of the mainstream press all over the world.  The US had a choice and made the cold war choice to support their Thai allies and try to stop the North Vietnamese from annexing Cambodia.   Thus the US provided food aid to all Cambodians including THE KHMER ROUGE post 1980. The US also tried to stop the North Vietnamese from getting their taking of Phnom Penh recognized at the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN.  The US was trying to stop North Vietnam from getting international recognition at the UN of their armed invasion and attempted annex of Cambodia.  Personally I think taking out the Khmer Rouge is the only good thing the North Vietnamese government ever did but that doesn&lt;92&gt;t mean I would support the North Vietnamese annexing Cambodia by getting international recognition at the UN.  Also as much as I an anti Khmer Rouge that does not mean I would support staving what was left of them plus all the innocent Cambodians caught up in the war by not providing food aid etc to the refugee camps and Khmer Rouge survivors in the post 1980 period.  You tried to play smoke and mirrors with the dates by implying the US funded and supported the Khmer Rouge rise to power in the late 60s and 70s. The US did not do this but instead did the opposite and funded and supported the Khmer Republic in their civil war against the Khmer Rouge.  As corrupt and screwed up at the Khmer Republic was if they would have won over the Khmer Rouge they wouldn't have killed 2 million Cambodians like those Socialist Heroes the Khmer rouge did.   The Khmer Rouge in their rise to power and the subsequent genocide were supported and funded by their socialist allies the Red Chinese.  The Khmer Rouge genocide happened between 1975 (YEAR ZERO) and April 17 1979 when the Red Chinese were funding them not the USA.  The US cold war strategy worked and Cambodia stayed in dependent and the Khmer Rouge stayed out of power and eventually turned on itself with thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers defecting and finally what was left turning on Pol Pot himself.  The North Vietnamese were contained and the dominos never fell.  I.e. you and the rest of the Marxists lost another one.  JJ fleming took you apart on these points quite well in his posts message 488, 494 and 500 but I just had to get the boot in myself.

Not to worry Ozzie, you can be assured that I am now very 'informed' of that 'special' reality and our actions will reflect that knowledge.

       "\t      I don't think a sustained hostility towards Jews by Arabs predates the arrival of Zionists in Palestine, Grant.  I mean Zionists and not Jews.  I mean people who arrived there with the express intention of creating a new nation.    Undoubtedly, Jews did not enjoy equality of status with Muslims in Muslim lands over the centuries, but then nor did people of any other faith.  They were certainly not of the lowest status.  Nor were they subject to the periodic pogroms in Arab lands that they endured in Europe.  On the whole, they were not badly treated in the context of the times.

       "\t Mistress,  Yes AQ types make up their own lines, but is it really such a good idea to confirm what they are saying?   Today's paper reports that the US and Israel planned the attack on Lebanon months ago. What is the justification for that? And doesn't it play straight into the hands of those who say the US is out to destroy Islam?  AQ is a small group, no more than a few thousand active members. From the press here it is reported that last weeks plot was foiled through a tip-off from a British Muslim and a few arrests in Pakistan. My take is we would be far more effective in dealing with that threat if we saw it as a police and security issue and not a \"war on terror\". Recent events would appear to bear that out. Seeing enemies rather than criminals legitimises those you are up against and therefore weakens the cooperation you are likely to get from  those who do not believe in your self-righteousness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & 0 &  9\\\\\n",

       "\t      The fact that you're missing here is what economists call PPP:  Purchasing Power Parity.  Goods are much cheaper in the US.  Even in the poorest parts of America, or at least the poorest parts that I've ever been to, people are very fat and have big cars.  They don't appear to be starving to me.  I'm sure you're right that the perpetrators of the Paris Carbecues are given more of ordinary taxpayers' money than they would be in the US.  How this benefits either them or France, however, is not clear from your explanation.  Incidentally, with respect to the redundant Guardian statistics on child poverty, the measure of child poverty that they're using is relative.  Since none of the people discussing these figures appear to understand even the most rudimentary statistics (normal distributions and standard deviations) because they're all sociology students, here's a quick summary:  The percentage figures that you call \"child poverty\" are actually a measure of the inequality of income distribution.  America appears to have a higher child poverty rate because it has a more unequal distribution.  And before you come back with 'Aha!', let me say I'm not against income inequality in the slightest.  Countries that do not have income inequality are either, as Gavin alluded, totalitarian dictatorships with a life expectancy of 40 or doomed social experiments like France.     Peace, wages and low taxes.  An illegal immigrant from Central America finding himself in New York will find a job, pay low taxes and experience less crime than an Algerian immigrant in the centre of Paris.  Don't forget all those middle class students are on the streets of Paris right now, campaigning against jobs.  So if you're an Algerian going to France, you're doing so because you expect a life of handouts.  But an immigrant to America is expecting a life of wages that will lead them into the middle class. & 0 & 17\\\\\n",

       "\t Stuart,  I think you know quite a bit about being shallow as you demonstrate that through your failure to recognize the link between your narrow mined hero Karl Marx and Communist atrocities.  In your convoluted logic you seek to make inane claims while ignoring dates and facts. I can't help you if you are unable to comprehend simple dates. The US did not fund or approve of the Khmer Rouge even your link says that the humanitarian funds from the west came AFTER the Khrmer Rouge were driven into a corner by the other Communists , N. Vietnam. The Killing fields were just coming to the worlds attention as Cambodia was sealed off and all foriegners were exterminated.   I can't help it if in your zeal to demonize the US you become deluded.  Your Marxist / Communist propoganda politics are are surely part of your deliberate untruthful agenda.

       "\t      Nice try, but you can't wiggle out of things that way.  Let's summarise the position:  1.  You said you are a Nazi and an anti-semite and are rather proud of it.  2.  You said that the Koran is a fairy story, so the bit that says that believers have to kill Christians and Jews doesn't matter.  3. You said that the Talmud (which is not a holy scripture like the koran, but an iron age commentary on the bronze age Torah), while still being a fairy story, should be taken seriously.  4. The worst calumny you could find to lay against the Jews is that they require non-Jewish girls to undergo a ritual bath when they convert.  I think you're going down a dead end with this one, because each round of posting makes you appear more bigoted but less connected with the real world.  I think you would better off saying \"Look, I hate Jews but I don't really know why (it may be something to do with Jesus), therefore I will grasp at any straw.\"  This would be more in line with standard BBC policy.

       "\t      You do not seem to understand how the West has operatred in oil rich Middle Eastern countries. The USA made a deal in 1945 to protect the Saudi royal family in return for oil wealth. The Saudi population have not gained the benfits of the wealth.   When the British backed Iraqi monarch was overthrown in 1958, the West supported the right wing Baa'thists against the radical nationalists. Again, the ordinary Iraqis missed out.  The West sponsored a coup to overthrow the nationalist in Iran in 1953, placing its puppet monarch on the thrown. When the monarch was overthrown in 1979 the West gave encouragement to Iraq to wage an eight year war against Iran. The war was financed by the Arab sheikdoms that were friendly to the West.

       "\t anyhow, the greenhouses were bought for about <a3>7.2 for a population currently about 1.7 million ?  they were bought by former world bank head MrWolfen... and Yossi Beillein with their Economic co-operation foundation thingy about 2 weeks before the pull-out. Settlers had already (?) started destroying or dismantling their greenhouses, probably out of malice   and from what I can make out, the plot is ....  we (the charity) will buy the greenhouses off you settlers for the palestinians as long as you dont smash them up. since we dont trust you and are concerned you might not be tempted enough, we will give you half the money up front and half after you have been removed.   as far as I can make out, some were unuasable or whatever. they also need a market that will buy their goods.  from what i saw, the palestininas were looting in quite an orderly fashion. it wasnt just for the sake of destroying them.

Combination of those two will eliminate complaining about poor quality of sausages...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & 1 & 1391\\\\\n",

       "\t Hi stuart davison,  Stuart Davison quote: <93>I've not lied at all. Nice to see you admit that US funded Pol Pot.<94>   I was waiting for you to finally cave in to the bashing you are taking and try to play <93>smoke and mirrors<94> with the dates. I am just sorry you tried this defection to late on Friday for me to get the first punch in. Instead JJ fleming got that honor.  In 1980 the North Vietnamese in a <93>commie on Commie<94> blood bath had pushed the Khmer Rouge to the Thai border on the west side of Cambodia. There was a huge refugee issue with potentially thousands and thousands of Cambodians being pushed or fleeing to Thailand to escape the North Vietnamese troops or simply starvation.  Before under the Khmer Rouge the Cambodians just starved to death but now with a Khmer Rouge/North Vietnamese war going on they had the chance to jump the border and swamp Thailand (a US cold war ally).  The US along with NGOs supplied the Cambodian refugee camps AND KHMER ROUGE with food as a counter weight to the North Vietnamese take over of Cambodia. At the height of the cold war the US was scared of the domino effect on Thailand with thousands and thousands of Cambodian refugees fleeing and being pushed across the border.  It was at this time (post April 17th 1979) with the Vietnamese toppling of the Khmer Rouge that the killing fields, collective farming Gulags and all the death came to the attention of the mainstream press all over the world.  The US had a choice and made the cold war choice to support their Thai allies and try to stop the North Vietnamese from annexing Cambodia.   Thus the US provided food aid to all Cambodians including THE KHMER ROUGE post 1980. The US also tried to stop the North Vietnamese from getting their taking of Phnom Penh recognized at the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN.  The US was trying to stop North Vietnam from getting international recognition at the UN of their armed invasion and attempted annex of Cambodia.  Personally I think taking out the Khmer Rouge is the only good thing the North Vietnamese government ever did but that doesn<92>t mean I would support the North Vietnamese annexing Cambodia by getting international recognition at the UN.  Also as much as I an anti Khmer Rouge that does not mean I would support staving what was left of them plus all the innocent Cambodians caught up in the war by not providing food aid etc to the refugee camps and Khmer Rouge survivors in the post 1980 period.  You tried to play smoke and mirrors with the dates by implying the US funded and supported the Khmer Rouge rise to power in the late 60s and 70s. The US did not do this but instead did the opposite and funded and supported the Khmer Republic in their civil war against the Khmer Rouge.  As corrupt and screwed up at the Khmer Republic was if they would have won over the Khmer Rouge they wouldn't have killed 2 million Cambodians like those Socialist Heroes the Khmer rouge did.   The Khmer Rouge in their rise to power and the subsequent genocide were supported and funded by their socialist allies the Red Chinese.  The Khmer Rouge genocide happened between 1975 (YEAR ZERO) and April 17 1979 when the Red Chinese were funding them not the USA.  The US cold war strategy worked and Cambodia stayed in dependent and the Khmer Rouge stayed out of power and eventually turned on itself with thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers defecting and finally what was left turning on Pol Pot himself.  The North Vietnamese were contained and the dominos never fell.  I.e. you and the rest of the Marxists lost another one.  JJ fleming took you apart on these points quite well in his posts message 488, 494 and 500 but I just had to get the boot in myself.  Warmest Regards, Smoker & 1 & 1393\\\\\n",

       "\t \"I will support people I trust, but there is nothing special about America or Americans, and they need my support less than most.\"  Exactly...and that is the attitude that Americans have picked up on, despite the countless times over the last 100 years we came to the aid of Europeans, (at the expense of others and ourselves).  Not to worry Ozzie, you can be assured that I am now very 'informed' of that 'special' reality and our actions will reflect that knowledge.

       "|      I don't think a sustained hostility towards Jews by Arabs predates the arrival of Zionists in Palestine, Grant.  I mean Zionists and not Jews.  I mean people who arrived there with the express intention of creating a new nation.    Undoubtedly, Jews did not enjoy equality of status with Muslims in Muslim lands over the centuries, but then nor did people of any other faith.  They were certainly not of the lowest status.  Nor were they subject to the periodic pogroms in Arab lands that they endured in Europe.  On the whole, they were not badly treated in the context of the times.

       "| Mistress,  Yes AQ types make up their own lines, but is it really such a good idea to confirm what they are saying?   Today's paper reports that the US and Israel planned the attack on Lebanon months ago. What is the justification for that? And doesn't it play straight into the hands of those who say the US is out to destroy Islam?  AQ is a small group, no more than a few thousand active members. From the press here it is reported that last weeks plot was foiled through a tip-off from a British Muslim and a few arrests in Pakistan. My take is we would be far more effective in dealing with that threat if we saw it as a police and security issue and not a \"war on terror\". Recent events would appear to bear that out. Seeing enemies rather than criminals legitimises those you are up against and therefore weakens the cooperation you are likely to get from  those who do not believe in your self-righteousness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 0 |  9 |\n",

Sorry guys we really don't like socialists and Commies so we out manaveour you everytime...hehe.   The French social welfare system will either change or collapse as jobs move to the far east , and the feeding of the pension system dries up.     No more free lunch Euro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1 | 16 |\n",
       "|      The fact that you're missing here is what economists call PPP:  Purchasing Power Parity.  Goods are much cheaper in the US.  Even in the poorest parts of America, or at least the poorest parts that I've ever been to, people are very fat and have big cars.  They don't appear to be starving to me.  I'm sure you're right that the perpetrators of the Paris Carbecues are given more of ordinary taxpayers' money than they would be in the US.  How this benefits either them or France, however, is not clear from your explanation.  Incidentally, with respect to the redundant Guardian statistics on child poverty, the measure of child poverty that they're using is relative.  Since none of the people discussing these figures appear to understand even the most rudimentary statistics (normal distributions and standard deviations) because they're all sociology students, here's a quick summary:  The percentage figures that you call \"child poverty\" are actually a measure of the inequality of income distribution.  America appears to have a higher child poverty rate because it has a more unequal distribution.  And before you come back with 'Aha!', let me say I'm not against income inequality in the slightest.  Countries that do not have income inequality are either, as Gavin alluded, totalitarian dictatorships with a life expectancy of 40 or doomed social experiments like France.     Peace, wages and low taxes.  An illegal immigrant from Central America finding himself in New York will find a job, pay low taxes and experience less crime than an Algerian immigrant in the centre of Paris.  Don't forget all those middle class students are on the streets of Paris right now, campaigning against jobs.  So if you're an Algerian going to France, you're doing so because you expect a life of handouts.  But an immigrant to America is expecting a life of wages that will lead them into the middle class. | 0 | 17 |\n",
       "| stuart  What about this?   He claims that there are \"many American media reports\" which have substituted \"disputed\" for \"occupied.\" Even the paper he wrote this gibberish in stated in 2005 both in editorials and news stories, referred to the West Bank (and sometimes including also the Gaza Strip) as \"occupied\" more than a dozen times. In contrast, not a single news story, editorial or even guest Op-Ed refers to the territories as \"disputed\" in the entire year.

I'm often confused about statements posted on this messageboard pretending like they're saying something concrete and therefore arguable, maybe I am just missing something, as in this case:  Please give examples of some of these \"anti semitist\" statements that you don't understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 0 | 1371 |\n",

       "| Stuart,  I think you know quite a bit about being shallow as you demonstrate that through your failure to recognize the link between your narrow mined hero Karl Marx and Communist atrocities.  In your convoluted logic you seek to make inane claims while ignoring dates and facts. I can't help you if you are unable to comprehend simple dates. The US did not fund or approve of the Khmer Rouge even your link says that the humanitarian funds from the west came AFTER the Khrmer Rouge were driven into a corner by the other Communists , N. Vietnam. The Killing fields were just coming to the worlds attention as Cambodia was sealed off and all foriegners were exterminated.   I can't help it if in your zeal to demonize the US you become deluded.  Your Marxist / Communist propoganda politics are are surely part of your deliberate untruthful agenda.  You're a sad Communist relic that 'spins' the worlds events to serve your Communist agenda.

Israel took the territory in a war of self defence. They are entitled to keep it until a peace deal is reached and by the looks of palestinian behaviour that won't be anytime soon. Since Israel withdrew from Gaza, 150 odd missiles have been fired from the territory. It doesn't really set a good example for the 'west bank' does it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1 | 1376 |\n",

       "|      Nice try, but you can't wiggle out of things that way.  Let's summarise the position:  1.  You said you are a Nazi and an anti-semite and are rather proud of it.  2.  You said that the Koran is a fairy story, so the bit that says that believers have to kill Christians and Jews doesn't matter.  3. You said that the Talmud (which is not a holy scripture like the koran, but an iron age commentary on the bronze age Torah), while still being a fairy story, should be taken seriously.  4. The worst calumny you could find to lay against the Jews is that they require non-Jewish girls to undergo a ritual bath when they convert.  I think you're going down a dead end with this one, because each round of posting makes you appear more bigoted but less connected with the real world.  I think you would better off saying \"Look, I hate Jews but I don't really know why (it may be something to do with Jesus), therefore I will grasp at any straw.\"  This would be more in line with standard BBC policy.

Before Zionism, you would have said that it's because they use the blood of christian children to make passover bread.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0 | 1380 |\n",

I can name more than two, that's certain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1 | 1384 |\n",
       "|      You do not seem to understand how the West has operatred in oil rich Middle Eastern countries. The USA made a deal in 1945 to protect the Saudi royal family in return for oil wealth. The Saudi population have not gained the benfits of the wealth.   When the British backed Iraqi monarch was overthrown in 1958, the West supported the right wing Baa'thists against the radical nationalists. Again, the ordinary Iraqis missed out.  The West sponsored a coup to overthrow the nationalist in Iran in 1953, placing its puppet monarch on the thrown. When the monarch was overthrown in 1979 the West gave encouragement to Iraq to wage an eight year war against Iran. The war was financed by the Arab sheikdoms that were friendly to the West.

       "| anyhow, the greenhouses were bought for about &lt;a3&gt;7.2 for a population currently about 1.7 million ?  they were bought by former world bank head MrWolfen... and Yossi Beillein with their Economic co-operation foundation thingy about 2 weeks before the pull-out. Settlers had already (?) started destroying or dismantling their greenhouses, probably out of malice   and from what I can make out, the plot is ....  we (the charity) will buy the greenhouses off you settlers for the palestinians as long as you dont smash them up. since we dont trust you and are concerned you might not be tempted enough, we will give you half the money up front and half after you have been removed.   as far as I can make out, some were unuasable or whatever. they also need a market that will buy their goods.  from what i saw, the palestininas were looting in quite an orderly fashion. it wasnt just for the sake of destroying them.

       "| Hi stuart davison,  Stuart Davison quote: &lt;93&gt;I've not lied at all. Nice to see you admit that US funded Pol Pot.&lt;94&gt;   I was waiting for you to finally cave in to the bashing you are taking and try to play &lt;93&gt;smoke and mirrors&lt;94&gt; with the dates. I am just sorry you tried this defection to late on Friday for me to get the first punch in. Instead JJ fleming got that honor.  In 1980 the North Vietnamese in a &lt;93&gt;commie on Commie&lt;94&gt; blood bath had pushed the Khmer Rouge to the Thai border on the west side of Cambodia. There was a huge refugee issue with potentially thousands and thousands of Cambodians being pushed or fleeing to Thailand to escape the North Vietnamese troops or simply starvation.  Before under the Khmer Rouge the Cambodians just starved to death but now with a Khmer Rouge/North Vietnamese war going on they had the chance to jump the border and swamp Thailand (a US cold war ally).  The US along with NGOs supplied the Cambodian refugee camps AND KHMER ROUGE with food as a counter weight to the North Vietnamese take over of Cambodia. At the height of the cold war the US was scared of the domino effect on Thailand with thousands and thousands of Cambodian refugees fleeing and being pushed across the border.  It was at this time (post April 17th 1979) with the Vietnamese toppling of the Khmer Rouge that the killing fields, collective farming Gulags and all the death came to the attention of the mainstream press all over the world.  The US had a choice and made the cold war choice to support their Thai allies and try to stop the North Vietnamese from annexing Cambodia.   Thus the US provided food aid to all Cambodians including THE KHMER ROUGE post 1980. The US also tried to stop the North Vietnamese from getting their taking of Phnom Penh recognized at the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN.  The US was trying to stop North Vietnam from getting international recognition at the UN of their armed invasion and attempted annex of Cambodia.  Personally I think taking out the Khmer Rouge is the only good thing the North Vietnamese government ever did but that doesn&lt;92&gt;t mean I would support the North Vietnamese annexing Cambodia by getting international recognition at the UN.  Also as much as I an anti Khmer Rouge that does not mean I would support staving what was left of them plus all the innocent Cambodians caught up in the war by not providing food aid etc to the refugee camps and Khmer Rouge survivors in the post 1980 period.  You tried to play smoke and mirrors with the dates by implying the US funded and supported the Khmer Rouge rise to power in the late 60s and 70s. The US did not do this but instead did the opposite and funded and supported the Khmer Republic in their civil war against the Khmer Rouge.  As corrupt and screwed up at the Khmer Republic was if they would have won over the Khmer Rouge they wouldn't have killed 2 million Cambodians like those Socialist Heroes the Khmer rouge did.   The Khmer Rouge in their rise to power and the subsequent genocide were supported and funded by their socialist allies the Red Chinese.  The Khmer Rouge genocide happened between 1975 (YEAR ZERO) and April 17 1979 when the Red Chinese were funding them not the USA.  The US cold war strategy worked and Cambodia stayed in dependent and the Khmer Rouge stayed out of power and eventually turned on itself with thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers defecting and finally what was left turning on Pol Pot himself.  The North Vietnamese were contained and the dominos never fell.  I.e. you and the rest of the Marxists lost another one.  JJ fleming took you apart on these points quite well in his posts message 488, 494 and 500 but I just had to get the boot in myself.  Warmest Regards, Smoker | 1 | 1393 |\n",

       "7         I don't think a sustained hostility towards Jews by Arabs predates the arrival of Zionists in Palestine, Grant.  I mean Zionists and not Jews.  I mean people who arrived there with the express intention of creating a new nation.    Undoubtedly, Jews did not enjoy equality of status with Muslims in Muslim lands over the centuries, but then nor did people of any other faith.  They were certainly not of the lowest status.  Nor were they subject to the periodic pogroms in Arab lands that they endured in Europe.  On the whole, they were not badly treated in the context of the times.  Most histories that I have read of the region, predominently written by Jewish authors as it happens, are agreed on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "9    Mistress,  Yes AQ types make up their own lines, but is it really such a good idea to confirm what they are saying?   Today's paper reports that the US and Israel planned the attack on Lebanon months ago. What is the justification for that? And doesn't it play straight into the hands of those who say the US is out to destroy Islam?  AQ is a small group, no more than a few thousand active members. From the press here it is reported that last weeks plot was foiled through a tip-off from a British Muslim and a few arrests in Pakistan. My take is we would be far more effective in dealing with that threat if we saw it as a police and security issue and not a \"war on terror\". Recent events would appear to bear that out.

Sorry guys we really don't like socialists and Commies so we out manaveour you everytime...hehe.   The French social welfare system will either change or collapse as jobs move to the far east , and the feeding of the pension system dries up.     No more free lunch Euro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "17        The fact that you're missing here is what economists call PPP:  Purchasing Power Parity.  Goods are much cheaper in the US.  Even in the poorest parts of America, or at least the poorest parts that I've ever been to, people are very fat and have big cars.  They don't appear to be starving to me.  I'm sure you're right that the perpetrators of the Paris Carbecues are given more of ordinary taxpayers' money than they would be in the US.  How this benefits either them or France, however, is not clear from your explanation.  Incidentally, with respect to the redundant Guardian statistics on child poverty, the measure of child poverty that they're using is relative.  Since none of the people discussing these figures appear to understand even the most rudimentary statistics (normal distributions and standard deviations) because they're all sociology students, here's a quick summary:  The percentage figures that you call \"child poverty\" are actually a measure of the inequality of income distribution.  America appears to have a higher child poverty rate because it has a more unequal distribution.  And before you come back with 'Aha!', let me say I'm not against income inequality in the slightest.  Countries that do not have income inequality are either, as Gavin alluded, totalitarian dictatorships with a life expectancy of 40 or doomed social experiments like France.     Peace, wages and low taxes.  An illegal immigrant from Central America finding himself in New York will find a job, pay low taxes and experience less crime than an Algerian immigrant in the centre of Paris.  Don't forget all those middle class students are on the streets of Paris right now, campaigning against jobs.  So if you're an Algerian going to France, you're doing so because you expect a life of handouts.  But an immigrant to America is expecting a life of wages that will lead them into the middle class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "18   stuart  What about this?   He claims that there are \"many American media reports\" which have substituted \"disputed\" for \"occupied.\" Even the paper he wrote this gibberish in stated in 2005 both in editorials and news stories, referred to the West Bank (and sometimes including also the Gaza Strip) as \"occupied\" more than a dozen times. In contrast, not a single news story, editorial or even guest Op-Ed refers to the territories as \"disputed\" in the entire year.

You don't see the hypocricy of saying that the rivers in North America ran with blood while ignoring the history of rivers in other continents? A person living on the scene of the world's greatest atrocities committed on other human beings is saying that the rivers in North AMerica are running in blood and you see no  hypocricy here???  When North Americans ever want a Europeans advice or opinions on anything along these lines they'll be sure to ask.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "30        I dont think reason and intellegence are the approach to take with you. To the degree that deciding on an approach involves effort, taking any approach is a complete waste of time.      that was stupid!     If you mean by control victimising pregnent women then maybe.

I'm often confused about statements posted on this messageboard pretending like they're saying something concrete and therefore arguable, maybe I am just missing something, as in this case:  Please give examples of some of these \"anti semitist\" statements that you don't understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1373 Stuart,  I think you know quite a bit about being shallow as you demonstrate that through your failure to recognize the link between your narrow mined hero Karl Marx and Communist atrocities.  In your convoluted logic you seek to make inane claims while ignoring dates and facts. I can't help you if you are unable to comprehend simple dates. The US did not fund or approve of the Khmer Rouge even your link says that the humanitarian funds from the west came AFTER the Khrmer Rouge were driven into a corner by the other Communists , N. Vietnam. The Killing fields were just coming to the worlds attention as Cambodia was sealed off and all foriegners were exterminated.   I can't help it if in your zeal to demonize the US you become deluded.  Your Marxist / Communist propoganda politics are are surely part of your deliberate untruthful agenda.

Tell me, what would you call the Vietnamese fighters who fought the US?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1376      'I won't dispute that, but that doesn't mean that Jews have a better claim.'  I never said they had a better claim but neither do the arabs. Why do you claim they do? Israel took the territory in a war of self defence. They are entitled to keep it until a peace deal is reached and by the looks of palestinian behaviour that won't be anytime soon. Since Israel withdrew from Gaza, 150 odd missiles have been fired from the territory.

       "1378      Nice try, but you can't wiggle out of things that way.  Let's summarise the position:  1.  You said you are a Nazi and an anti-semite and are rather proud of it.  2.  You said that the Koran is a fairy story, so the bit that says that believers have to kill Christians and Jews doesn't matter.  3. You said that the Talmud (which is not a holy scripture like the koran, but an iron age commentary on the bronze age Torah), while still being a fairy story, should be taken seriously.  4. The worst calumny you could find to lay against the Jews is that they require non-Jewish girls to undergo a ritual bath when they convert.  I think you're going down a dead end with this one, because each round of posting makes you appear more bigoted but less connected with the real world.  I think you would better off saying \"Look, I hate Jews but I don't really know why (it may be something to do with Jesus), therefore I will grasp at any straw.\"  This would be more in line with standard BBC policy.

I can name more than two, that's certain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1385      You do not seem to understand how the West has operatred in oil rich Middle Eastern countries. The USA made a deal in 1945 to protect the Saudi royal family in return for oil wealth. The Saudi population have not gained the benfits of the wealth.   When the British backed Iraqi monarch was overthrown in 1958, the West supported the right wing Baa'thists against the radical nationalists. Again, the ordinary Iraqis missed out.  The West sponsored a coup to overthrow the nationalist in Iran in 1953, placing its puppet monarch on the thrown. When the monarch was overthrown in 1979 the West gave encouragement to Iraq to wage an eight year war against Iran. The war was financed by the Arab sheikdoms that were friendly to the West.  And as for the Palestinians , they have been attacked by all and sundry and do not have a viable, functioning state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "1388 anyhow, the greenhouses were bought for about <a3>7.2 for a population currently about 1.7 million ?  they were bought by former world bank head MrWolfen... and Yossi Beillein with their Economic co-operation foundation thingy about 2 weeks before the pull-out. Settlers had already (?) started destroying or dismantling their greenhouses, probably out of malice   and from what I can make out, the plot is ....  we (the charity) will buy the greenhouses off you settlers for the palestinians as long as you dont smash them up. since we dont trust you and are concerned you might not be tempted enough, we will give you half the money up front and half after you have been removed.   as far as I can make out, some were unuasable or whatever. they also need a market that will buy their goods.  from what i saw, the palestininas were looting in quite an orderly fashion. it wasnt just for the sake of destroying them.  The people who ran and worked the greenhouses are still there, the Arabs who were volunteer slave labourers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Combination of those two will eliminate complaining about poor quality of sausages...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "1393 Hi stuart davison,  Stuart Davison quote: <93>I've not lied at all. Nice to see you admit that US funded Pol Pot.<94>   I was waiting for you to finally cave in to the bashing you are taking and try to play <93>smoke and mirrors<94> with the dates. I am just sorry you tried this defection to late on Friday for me to get the first punch in. Instead JJ fleming got that honor.  In 1980 the North Vietnamese in a <93>commie on Commie<94> blood bath had pushed the Khmer Rouge to the Thai border on the west side of Cambodia. There was a huge refugee issue with potentially thousands and thousands of Cambodians being pushed or fleeing to Thailand to escape the North Vietnamese troops or simply starvation.  Before under the Khmer Rouge the Cambodians just starved to death but now with a Khmer Rouge/North Vietnamese war going on they had the chance to jump the border and swamp Thailand (a US cold war ally).  The US along with NGOs supplied the Cambodian refugee camps AND KHMER ROUGE with food as a counter weight to the North Vietnamese take over of Cambodia. At the height of the cold war the US was scared of the domino effect on Thailand with thousands and thousands of Cambodian refugees fleeing and being pushed across the border.  It was at this time (post April 17th 1979) with the Vietnamese toppling of the Khmer Rouge that the killing fields, collective farming Gulags and all the death came to the attention of the mainstream press all over the world.  The US had a choice and made the cold war choice to support their Thai allies and try to stop the North Vietnamese from annexing Cambodia.   Thus the US provided food aid to all Cambodians including THE KHMER ROUGE post 1980. The US also tried to stop the North Vietnamese from getting their taking of Phnom Penh recognized at the legitimate government of Cambodia at the UN.  The US was trying to stop North Vietnam from getting international recognition at the UN of their armed invasion and attempted annex of Cambodia.  Personally I think taking out the Khmer Rouge is the only good thing the North Vietnamese government ever did but that doesn<92>t mean I would support the North Vietnamese annexing Cambodia by getting international recognition at the UN.  Also as much as I an anti Khmer Rouge that does not mean I would support staving what was left of them plus all the innocent Cambodians caught up in the war by not providing food aid etc to the refugee camps and Khmer Rouge survivors in the post 1980 period.  You tried to play smoke and mirrors with the dates by implying the US funded and supported the Khmer Rouge rise to power in the late 60s and 70s. The US did not do this but instead did the opposite and funded and supported the Khmer Republic in their civil war against the Khmer Rouge.  As corrupt and screwed up at the Khmer Republic was if they would have won over the Khmer Rouge they wouldn't have killed 2 million Cambodians like those Socialist Heroes the Khmer rouge did.   The Khmer Rouge in their rise to power and the subsequent genocide were supported and funded by their socialist allies the Red Chinese.  The Khmer Rouge genocide happened between 1975 (YEAR ZERO) and April 17 1979 when the Red Chinese were funding them not the USA.  The US cold war strategy worked and Cambodia stayed in dependent and the Khmer Rouge stayed out of power and eventually turned on itself with thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers defecting and finally what was left turning on Pol Pot himself.  The North Vietnamese were contained and the dominos never fell.  I.e. you and the rest of the Marxists lost another one.  JJ fleming took you apart on these points quite well in his posts message 488, 494 and 500 but I just had to get the boot in myself.  Warmest Regards, Smoker\n",
